Recorded Future Sandbox allows clients to work smarter, respond faster, and strengthen their
defenses through automation and orchestration. The Recorded Future Sandbox App provides a number of
actions that enable the use of our sandbox solution.

This app requires a correctly set up Recorded Future API Token to use.
